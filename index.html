            <h3>User Research</h3>
            <p>User research focuses on understanding user behaviors, needs, and motivations through interviews, surveys, usability evaluations and other forms of feedback methodologies. It is used to understand how people interact with products and evaluate whether design solutions meet their needs</p>

            <h3>User Interface Design</h3>
            <p>User Interface Design focuses on anticipating what users might need to do and ensuring that the interface has elements that are easy to access, understand, and use to facilitate those actions. UI brings together concepts from interaction design, visual design, and information architecture.</p>

              <h3>Palace Lofts</h3>
              <h4>Roles: Research | Puzzle Solving | Fabrication</h4>
              <p>Spanning the 5th floor of a historic theater, The Palace Loft is a “Place For Friends” for a magnanemous community leader who is passionate about hosting.
    
                The kitchen is open with an intentionally shared waterfall table/ countertop to the main living area. It creates the sense that they easily flow right into each other.
                
                A curved steel wall with a deep steel doorway is geared more toward private, individual space with an expansive landscaped roof garden and fireplace adjacent to the master suite. </p>

              <h3>The Octopus Initiative</h3>
              <h4>Roles: Research | XD | Fabrication </h4>
              <p>Replacing the museum’s previous Open Shelf Library, I worked with the MCA and Hunter Leggitt Studios to design and fabricate custom art storage display units out of steel and glass for visitors to efficiently and playfully interact with the art collection. 
    
                Interactive display kiosks allow visitors to quickly access the entire collection and sign up for the lending lottery.
                
                  In the first year alone, it is estimated that over 100,000 visitors have interacted with the exhibit.

              <h3>Redesign of Existing Website with Team</h3>
              <h4>Roles: Research | UX | UI | Testing </h4>
              <p>A traditional Japanese Aikido Dojo in Nashville Tennessee was finding it more difficult to fill their beginner classes. 
    
                Using UX research practices we found the common drop off point in the website enrollment process. We reorganized the information hierarchy on the site to allow visitors to quickly access the classes and sign up. The changes we made are currently in development.
